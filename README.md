# Forum App


This project marks the completion of a 6-month, 1064-hour Front End Software Developer course at CodeAcademy. The task involved crafting a Forum App with essential components, including an Authentication page (Registration and Login), a structured Forum hierarchy featuring Subcategories and Discussion Pages, and dedicated Profile and Messages sections.

Technologies used:

- Node.js for server-side scripting, incorporating routers, middleware, and controllers.
- React.js for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- React Router to facilitate seamless navigation within the application.
- Bootstrap for an aesthetically pleasing and clean design.
- Zustand (or any other React state management library) for efficient state handling.
- JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication, ensuring all actions are executed with a valid token.
- Password hashing for heightened security measures.
- MongoDB as the database to store and manage application data.
- Dotenv for managing environment variables and configurations.
